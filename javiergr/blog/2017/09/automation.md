summary: Why do you automate?

Last night I decided to automate [this blog](https://github.com/graffic/javiergr). So when I commit, [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/graffic/javiergr) then builds and uploads it to [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com). This is not something new. GitHub [does exactly that](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-as-a-static-site-generator-with-github-pages/) for you if you use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com). Also, at work, everything is automated, and if something isn't it feels weird.

But in the quietness of my living room, I was able to observe what happened to my relationship with the project itself. I became more eager to work on the project. I tend to justify automation because it saves time, removes that repetitive and error prone job that no one is happy to do, etc. But the key last night was reducing the **cognitive load**, so you can focus on the interesting parts, and that made me **happy**, even if I just saved one command and did some upgrades.
